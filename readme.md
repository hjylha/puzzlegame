A cute little children's puzzle as a Python program with GUI via tkinter. However, this one does not have candy as a reward for solving it, since one can simply press the *find a solution* button.

Launch the game by typing

`python play.py`

You can select a piece by clicking or pressing the key corresponding to its "name". Once selected, the piece can be moved with arrow keys or by clicking on an empty spot. Alternatively, you can just drag the pieces around.

Possible issues:
- Solver does not distinguish between mirrored positions, which might cause problems.


Things to add maybe:
- picture of the real life puzzle for reference
- saving positions to databases instead of files
- exploring weird paths (far from solutions)
- would qt be better than tkinter?
